4. PAYMENT AND REFUND POLICY.
You agree to pay a subscription license fee in U.S. dollars for use of the Products in accordance with the Subscription Plan You selected when You created an account (“License Fee”) upon the conclusion of the trial period provided to new users of the Products, and monthly thereafter. Any charges for additional functionality or features used in connection with Your use of the Subscription Plan will be billed to Your account on a monthly basis. The amount and payment terms for such License Fee are as disclosed to You within the Web Application or as provided by a Kocomojo representative who You may call or who may contact You regarding a custom license agreement in connection with Your use of the Products. You may be prompted from time to time with offers to upgrade Your Subscription Plan for an additional License Fee, which such offers may be sent by Kocomojo through the dashboard, direct messages or other means of communication via the Web Application or via contact information you have provided to Kocomojo. If Kocomojo in its sole discretion chooses to establish fees and payment terms for the use of any upgraded or additional aspects of the Products, Kocomojo will provide notice of such terms as provided in Section 15 below, and You may elect to stop using the Products rather than incurring fees. If You continue to use the Products following such notice, You shall pay a separate License Fee in U.S. dollars. All License Fees shall be exclusive of any and all taxes, and You are responsible for payment of such taxes (excluding those based on Kocomojo’s net income). You agree to hold harmless Kocomojo from all claims and liability arising from Your failure to report or pay such taxes. Any unpaid portion of any License Fee, or other fee, payable by You to Kocomojo under this Agreement, as of the date of expiration or termination for any reason, shall be immediately due and payable. Past due amounts shall be subject to a monthly service charge of three and one-half percent (3.5%) per month of the unpaid balance or the maximum rate allowable by law. To the fullest extent permitted by law, You waive all claims relating to License Fees unless such claims are made within thirty (30) days after the applicable License Fees are charged (this does not affect any of Your rights with and/or respecting Your credit card issuer). Refunds (if any) are at the discretion of Kocomojo and will only be in the form of credit for the Products. Nothing in this Agreement obligates Kocomojo to extend credit to any party.
 
5. USER DATA.
You agree that the Software and Products will enable You to share and receive information about Your employees, end users and/or customers with and from Kocomojo, which may include geolocation and other personally identifiable information. As a condition of Your use of the Software and Products, You must obtain express consent to collect and share such employee, end user or customer information with Kocomojo by specifically including language in Your privacy policy requiring employees, users and/or customers to accept the terms of Kocomojo’s Privacy Policy and allowing for the collection and transmittal of such information to Kocomojo.

If Kocomojo fails to remedy such breach within a reasonable time period after receipt of Your notice, You shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement. This limited warranty shall be void if Kocomojo determines that the Software or Products have been used other than in accordance with the Documentation, abused, modified, altered or otherwise subjected to damage from accident or acts of nature. You agree to comply with Kocomojo’s reasonable instructions with respect to the alleged defective Software or Products.
 
7.2 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN SECTION 7.1.1, THE SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED BY KOCOMOJO TO YOU “AS IS,” AND KOCOMOJO MAKES NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THE SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS AND SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND AGAINST INFRINGEMENT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE BY LAW. KOCOMOJO DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, OPERATE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION OR BE ERROR-FREE. YOU WILL BEAR ALL RISKS RELATING TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS, AND ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

8.3 If a Claim arises, or in Kocomojo’s opinion is likely to arise, Kocomojo may at its own expense obtain for You the right to continue using the Software or Products, modify the Software or Products to make any of them non-infringing, or substitute other software or products of similar capability and functionality. If none of these options are reasonably available to Kocomojo, Kocomojo may terminate this Agreement. THIS SECTION 8 STATES THE ENTIRE OBLIGATION OF KOCOMOJO AND THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES TO YOU WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT OR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.
 
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
IN NO EVENT SHALL KOCOMOJO BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS), OR BE LIABLE TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, EVEN IF KOCOMOJO HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. Kocomojo’s entire liability under this Agreement for any damages from any cause whatsoever, regardless of form or action, whether in contract, negligence or otherwise, shall in no event exceed an amount equal to $100.
 
10. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
Kocomojo and You agree to keep confidential and to use only for purposes of performing or as otherwise permitted under this Agreement, any proprietary or confidential information of the other party disclosed pursuant to this Agreement which is marked as confidential or which would reasonably be considered of a confidential nature (“Confidential Information”). The obligation of confidentiality shall not apply to information which is publicly available through authorized disclosure, is known by the receiving party at the time of disclosure as evidenced in writing or is rightfully obtained from a third party who has the right to disclose it or which is required by law, government order or request to be disclosed; provided that the disclosing party will give prompt written notice to the non-disclosing party of such order in order to permit the non-disclosing party to seek confidential treatment of such information, and provided that the disclosing party will only furnish that portion of the Confidential Information it is required to disclose. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, You acknowledge and agree that the Software and Products shall be deemed to constitute Confidential Information of Kocomojo. Kocomojo and You agree to maintain all Confidential Information of the other party in confidence to the same extent that each of Kocomojo and You protects its own similar Confidential Information. Kocomojo and You agree to take reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information of the other party, including, without limitation, by disclosing such Confidential Information only to its employees or agents (a) with a need to know such information, (b) who are parties to appropriate agreements or confidentiality obligations sufficient to comply with this Section, and (c) who are informed of the nondisclosure/non-use obligations imposed by this Section, and the receiving party will take appropriate steps to implement and enforce such non-disclosure/non-use obligations. Upon any termination of this Agreement, each party shall return to the other party all Confidential Information of the other party, and all copies thereof, in the possession, custody or control of the party unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement.
 
11. TERM AND TERMINATION.
This Agreement shall continue in effect for so long as You utilize or have access to the Software or Products. Kocomojo may terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason or for no reason without prior written notice to You. You may terminate this Agreement by giving Kocomojo thirty (30) days advance written notice of such termination. Upon termination of this Agreement, the license granted to You under this Agreement will revert to Kocomojo and You will cease all use of the Software or Products. Within ten (10) business days of termination, You will destroy or deliver to Kocomojo all copies of the Software or any portion thereof in Your possession or under Your control, and You will certify to Kocomojo such destruction or delivery. Your failure to comply with the obligations of this Section will constitute unauthorized use of the Software or Products, entitling Kocomojo to equitable relief as provided in this Agreement as well as Kocomojo’s other legal and equitable remedies. Sections 3, 4, 5, 7 – 10 and 12 – 15 shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement.

13.2 System Tampering. Under no circumstances shall You, or third parties acting on Your behalf, modify, decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer the Software or Products. You shall be responsible for any breaches or violations of this Agreement by Your employees or other such third parties.

At a minimum, however, You shall reimburse Kocomojo, at its then current rates, for all costs incurred by Kocomojo in investigating and correcting such error or malfunction.
 
14. THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE.
14.1 You acknowledge that the Software and Products may contain or be accompanied by certain third party or open source software products which may be provided subject to licenses which disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including, without limitation, the Apache License, the General Public License, and other licenses (“Third Party Components”).

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement may be modified only by a writing signed by an authorized representative of each party. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware exclusive of its conflict of laws principles.

The award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon both parties. The parties may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction or other interim or conservatory relief, as necessary, without breach of this arbitration agreement and without any abridgment of the powers of the arbitrator. The prevailing party shall be awarded its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs in any arbitration, suit or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement. Notices under this Agreement shall be in writing, addressed to Kocomojo at its address below or by sending You a notice via email, and shall be deemed given when delivered personally, or by facsimile (with confirmation of receipt), conventional mail (registered or certified, postage prepaid with return receipt requested) or overnight courier. Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended or is to be construed to create a partnership, joint venture or agency relationship. If any provision of this Agreement shall be declared invalid, illegal or unenforceable, all remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect. You may not delegate, assign or transfer this Agreement, or any of Your rights and obligations under this Agreement, and any attempt to do so shall be void. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit or delay Kocomojo’s ability to seek immediate relief at law or in equity for any breach by You of the license. No waiver of any rights hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of the same or other right on any other occasion.
